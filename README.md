# Yuya Mukai
### AI Researcher · Data Scientist · Game Developer

Building autonomous AI systems, idea-generation engines, and experimental games.

---

## 🧠 Core Vision
I design systems where multiple AI agents interact, debate, and evolve ideas —  
treating intelligence as an emergent property of complex interaction.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Multi-agent AI
- Autonomous ideation systems
- Artificial life with LLMs
- Experimental game mechanics

## 🚀 Main Projects

### 🧠 Eureka
**Multi-Agent Idea Generation System**

A structured LLM-based system where agents generate, critique, defend, and evolve ideas.

- Generator / Critic / Advocate / Skeptic agents
- Multi-LLM support
- CLI + Web UI
- High test coverage
- Cost tracking and caching

### ⚡ mad_spark_alt
**Experimental AI Ideation Engine**

A lightweight system for rapid idea mutation, evaluation, and evolution.

---

### 🧠 tunix
**Kaggle Competition — Google Tunix Post-Training Challenge**

Participation in a Kaggle competition hosted by Google’s Tunix team,  
focused on post-training techniques for large language models on TPU.

- LLM post-training
- TPU-based experimentation
- Competition-driven optimization

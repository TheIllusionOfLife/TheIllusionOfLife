## Core Vision
My work sits at the intersection of:

- Multi-agent AI
- Autonomous ideation systems
- Artificial life with LLMs
- Experimental game mechanics

## Featured Projects

### 💡Eureka
**Multi-Agent Idea Generation System**

A structured LLM-based system where agents generate, critique, defend, and evolve ideas.

- Generator / Critic / Advocate / Skeptic agents
- Multi-LLM support
- CLI + Web UI

### 🧬mad_spark_alt
**Experimental AI Ideation Engine**

A lightweight system for rapid idea mutation, evaluation, and evolution.
- Mimicking consultants' approach for problem solving
- Genetic algorithm to evolve ideas

### 🦾tunix
Kaggle Competition on post-training techniques for LLMs on TPU
- Google's LLM post-training library
- TPU-based experimentation
- Competition-driven optimization

### 🎃kiroween
A Project for Kiro's hachathon.

A fast-built experimental AI system which implements good old day personal websites with modern stack.
- Access counter, Spinning GIFs, BBS, and some annoying features
- TypeScript, React, shadcn/ui, Next.js, Zustand, Convex, Clerk, Vitest, fast-check, Vercel

### 🎩promote_autonomy
Autonomous AI Marketing Agent

An experimental system where AI agents generate promotional assets for your products.
- Python, Google ADK, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, Imagen, Veo, Firebase, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Next.js

### 🪪adult_certification
An educational game that tests real-world adult knowledge.  
Available to play at itch.io on browser.
